              "description": "Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor are expecting their first child. Taking to Instagram on Monday morning, Alia revealed she was pregnant by sharing a photo of her scan. The big news left their fans ecstatic and congratulations were in order as millions flooded the comments section to wish the couple. Alia and Ranbir tied the knot in 14 April this year.The couple had an intimate wedding celebration at home in the presence of family and close friends. Needless to say, the news has probably left Alia and Ranbir's family, friends and fans over the moon. Taking to Instagram, Alia's pregnancy announcement photo featured husband Ranbir Kapoor in the frame. In the photo, Alia can be seen lying on the hospital bed, with the lovebirds looking at the screen. She captioned the photo, Our baby ….. coming soon.  While the first photo was of Alia and Ranbir, the second picture featured a lion, a lioness and their cub. Probably a photo that Ranbir clicked on one of the many Safari trips he took with wife Alia Bhatt prior to their wedding.Recently, during the trailer launch of Shamshera, Ranbir spoke about Alia's presence in his life while referring to his famous movie dialogue. Revealing Alia Bhatt’s reaction to Shamshera’s trailer, Ranbir Kapoor said, “Alia had seen the teaser and loved it. She is in London right now, so once she wakes up she will see the trailer.He further added,Films aside, this is a big year for me as I even got married. I always said that we need tangdi kebab, and not dal chawal in life. But with experience I can say that nothing better than Dal Chawal. Alia is the tadka in dal chawal, the achar with it, she is everything and I could not have asked for a better partner in my life.Here's wishing Alia and Ranbir a hearty congratulations."

              "description": "It has recently come to light that Tom Hanks is an admirer of Aamir Khan as well. Aamir Khan happened to meet him somewhere in 2014 or 2015 when he flew down to Germany to have a meeting with acclaimed filmmaker Steven Spielberg. It so happened that Aamir Khan wished to remake Forrest Gump (1994) whose rights rested with its director Robert Zemeckis. Robert, however, refused to meet Aamir. Aamir tried a lot to set up the meeting but in vain. Left with no choice, he decided to meet Steven Spielberg, who was then shooting for his film Bridge Of Spies (2015). Interestingly, the film starred Tom Hanks, who also starred in Forrest Gump and whose role Aamir wanted to essay in the remake. Robert Zemeckis held Spielberg in high regard. As a result, Aamir felt that if Steven Spielberg would convince Robert, the latter would part with the remake rights of Forrest Gump. Aamir Khan reached the sets of Bridge Of Spies and met Steven Spielberg along with Tom Hanks. Steven Spielberg introduced Aamir to Tom Hanks as ‘James Cameron of India’. This is because according to the filmmaker, just like how James Cameron breaks his own box office records, so does Aamir! Tom Hanks, however, made it clear that he knows Aamir very well. He also admitted that he loved Aamir’s 2009 film 3 Idiots and that he has seen it as many as 3 times! Aamir Khan then told Steven Spielberg about his predicament about Robert Zemeckis. To which Spielberg told Aamir that his relationship with Zemeckis was like that of a father and a son. And like most fathers and sons, they don’t always get along well! He also revealed to Aamir that Robert Zemeckis was refusing to meet the superstar as he didn’t want to say ‘no’ to Aamir’s face. Nevertheless, Aamir Khan kept on trying. At last, he won the remake rights. The remake of Forrest Gump came to be known as Laal Singh Chaddha. It is all set to release on August 11, 2022, and is one of the most awaited films of the year."

The film was released on March 24 this year. Since then, it has garnered significant buzz. It also kickstarted a debate on the way pan-India films are perceived. These Bollywood superstars coming together for a picture like this is surely a sight for sore eyes. However, much to the disappointment of their fans, the photo is an edited one and is clearly a fake."

When the thought of out of sight is out of mind takes over, you don't have many choices. Today it is quite easy for me to sit and say that instead of doing those films I should have learned kung fu in China or anything else. Today it is easy for me to say that. But it wasn't the same 6-7 years ago. Back then I was just trying to understand myself and wondering what happened. My first film did well and everyone even appreciated it. But why weren't certain choices given to me after that? Then I get the answer that you should do the kind of films which have songs, and if the song is a hit, the film also works. But I didn't think that way. It worked for somebody, but may not work for me. But you still want to try because somebody is saying, either someone who is experienced or someone from your team. They come from a  place where they mean well to you.She further said, “Then you are told that only when you work with certain names, and that you need to get more films with the really big stars to be out there. Now, that may also be true. But I did that, but it didn't work for me. One of them had a very good role also. I am talking about Kaabil but unfortunately, that was also like ‘aapka role usme utna hi tha (you had a small role). But I could not figure out why people were thinking like that. Why aren't they thinking about how I performed in that film. We often talk about films made outside of our country where big stars do small roles in big films. Anyway, it is easy to talk about this today. But back then it sounded like you are complaining about every trivial thing. It is better to take a breather and reshuffle everything."

Now, the jury will deliberate over the case’s facts and findings and deliver their verdict next week. The high-profile defamation trial has seen its fair share of twists and turns. But now the question on everyone’s lips is what would be the outcome. As per reports, Johnny Depp is heavily favoured to emerge victorious in his suit against his ex-wife. But if he does win, what does that mean for Amber? We take a look.Johnny has sued Amber for $50 million saying she defamed him when she claimed to be a victim of domestic violence in a Washington Post op-ed in 2018. Johnny’s lawyers have said that even though Amber didn’t name him, the implication damaged his career. He has further alleged that Amber was abusive towards him during their marriage. Amber has countersued him for $100 million claiming that he has smeared her name by calling her a liar. She has maintained that she suffered physical and sexual abuse at Johnny’s hands. Both trials ran concurrently in a Virginia court for over six weeks. The hearings ended on May 27."

I strongly believe that acting is not real life in any form,” Gyllenhaal tells us.It’s been over three decades since Gyllenhaal has been working his way through in Hollywood, bringing different shades of complicated men on screen from cons to police officers. He is known for films such as Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, Zodiac, Nightcrawler, Spider-Man: Far from Home, The Guilty and Ambulance.Opening up about his method as an actor, the 41-year-old shares, “A lot of times people say that acting is pretend. I don’t believe acting is pretend. I think it’s a real access to your imagination and a sense of play. And then you can hopefully build the human you are with the stuff that has nothing to do with the acting, but more to do with life and the people you love and the things you go through good and bad”"

Despite his stardom, Tom has never had a film gross over $100 million on the opening weekend. But reports say that Maverick may just change that. Some estimates claim that the film could end up making $125 million in its opening weekend in the domestic market alone.According to a report in The Hollywood Reporter, “Top Gun 2 is easily headed for the biggest opening of Tom Cruise’s career at the domestic box office, with a four-day gross of at least $92 million, according to official tracking. And that’s a conservative estimate. Many pundits believe the critically acclaimed sequel could soar well north of $100 million domestically, but tracking — one of Hollywood’s favorite pastimes — has become fraught in the pandemic era. Exhibitors are especially bullish on the pic, and are even thinking $125 million-plus.”"

This conversation just reinforced my belief that there will be takers for Microsoft’s experimental Surface Laptop Studio, which blends certain elements of the desktop Surface Studio and the premium 2-in-1 Surface Book. It’s a mobile workstation that’s also a sketching slate and a portable home theater. I have been using the Surface Laptop Studio for a few days, and I am in love with this device even though it is not perfect. Here is my review."

You upload a photo of a face, check a box agreeing to the terms of service and then get a grid of photos of faces deemed similar, with links to where they appear on the internet. The New York Times used PimEyes on the faces of a dozen Times journalists, with their consent, to test its powers.PimEyes found photos of every person, some that the journalists had never seen before, even when they were wearing sunglasses or a mask, or their face was turned away from the camera, in the image used to conduct the search. PimEyes found one reporter dancing at an art museum event a decade ago, and crying after being proposed to, a photo that she didn’t particularly like but that the photographer had decided to use to advertise his business on Yelp. A tech reporter’s younger self was spotted in an awkward crush of fans at the Coachella music festival in 2011. A foreign correspondent appeared in countless wedding photos, evidently the life of every party, and in the blurry background of a photo taken of someone else at a Greek airport in 2019.

Since there was a lot of dust and mud on the vehicle, the staff at the service centre reportedly used a high-pressure water wash to clean the vehicle before inspecting it.Ather says that the service team discovered some cracks in the top casing of the battery pack. But by then, water had entered the battery casing due to the high-pressure wash. The company says that letting in water into the battery is an “impossible to solve scenario,” and that the scooter was “moved to a safer area,” as soon as this was observed."

The CMA said it was concerned Google sought to illegally favor its own ad exchange services, while taking steps to exclude the services offered by rivals.“Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers, who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs or put their content behind pay walls,” said Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s Chief Executive Officer.Watchdogs around the world have started to home in on the huge power that firms such as Google and Meta’s Facebook wield over ad markets — striking at the heart of the tech giants’ money making machines. Google faces a separate probe by the CMA into possible collusion over the way it operates online display advertising services.The CMA has been examining the way Google buys and sells advertising since at least 2020, saying that its advertising stack is a potential conflict of interest.

And recently, he dropped another video showcasing a power-packed workout.

Also, if one has back, shoulders, or lower body joint niggles, avoid doing the power clean. During movement, if there is any pain or discomfort, it is best to discontinue and do basic stretches."

On that account, it becomes necessary to understand whether yoga should be done on an empty stomach or notAnshuka Parwani, a yoga expert, and Pooja Makhija, a nutritionist took to Instagram to talk about this dilemma that many face.Pooja believes that it’s important to have something before starting with your exercise in the morning. It should be quite light and not too heavy to kickstart your metabolism.While both have contrasting opinions, they strongly agreed and upheld the point that you know your body better than anyone else. Hence, it’s important to observe and understand what your body is trying to tell you and do as one may deem fit. They said, if practising yoga on an empty stomach is suiting you better, do that. On the other hand, if it feels like you need something to get a better start, follow that as a part of your routine.    "

Hypertension is essentially high blood pressure, and those who suffer from it may not exhibit any symptoms initially as it develops over the course of many years. This lack of symptoms makes it undetectable in time to prevent it or take remedial action, experts say.“Holistic practices like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness, help handle stress in a productive and effective manner.

His fitness trainer, Pawan Jatwa, recently shared a video in which the Hero actor could be seen flexing his muscles. According to Bala Krishna Reddy Dabbedi, a fitness expert, and co-founder, director at Fittr, people usually think that they can pick up from where they left and that their original strength will be the same — “but that will not be the case”. “It’s easy to compare yourself to the times when you were training regularly. But, if there has been a gap in your gymming routine, it’s reasonable to see a decline in strength, endurance, and overall muscle,” he expressed.Assess again, test your current strength levels and train accordingly, he suggested. “There is something called muscle memory which helps one get back to their previous strength levels and muscle mass, but this takes times — from a few weeks to even some months. Just be consistent and positive till you get there. On resuming, do not start with an intense program. Keep it minimal, start slow, and you may even experience muscle soreness and pain. Eventually increase the intensity with every passing week,” she said."

A recent study in Diabetes Care found that women who get more steps have a lower risk of developing diabetes, compared to women who are more sedentary.1And a study in the journal Metabolites found that men who are more active have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to men who are more sedentary.2 It seems that physical activity significantly changes the body’s metabolite profile, and many of these changes are associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, says Maria Lankinen, PhD, research scientist, Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition at the University of Eastern Finland, and one of the researchers on the study published in Metabolites. Increased physical activity also improved insulin secretion.The study published in Diabetes Care focused on 4,838 older women (median age 78.9) without diabetes, who were followed for up to 6.9 years. Their steps were monitored by accelerometers to account for the number of steps and the intensity of steps, which were labeled as light-intensity or moderate- to vigorous-intensity.For diabetes among older adults, our findings indicate that moderate- to vigorous-intensity steps were more strongly associated with a lower risk of diabetes than light-intensity steps, adds John Bellettiere, PhD, an assistant professor of family medicine and public health at UC San Diego, and a co-author on the study."

The first performed supervised exercise twice a week with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) at a 90% peak heart rate. The second did moderate-intensity training at 70% peak heart rate. The third, a control group, did at least 30 minutes of daily activity, but at a low intensity and didn't have heart rate measured.There was one major aspect of improvement that wasn't related to heart rate or cortical thickness, Dr. Haberg adds—it was whether the participants felt control over their choices. For example, those who were able to choose their activity, where they exercised, and whether they exercised alone or with a training buddy tended to have more beneficial outcomes.rforming an activity chosen by the individual is key to better brain health, says Haberg. Also, diligently following physical activity guidelines provides a significant cardiorespiratory effect in healthy older adults. That type of control also can be part of maintaining a regular fitness routine, previous research suggests, because it can lead to greater enjoyment with exercise. For example, one study notes that about 50% of participants in exercise programs drop out in the first 6 months, but that those who feel positive emotions tend to have significantly higher levels of program adherence"

But if you have diabetes, then you must have been told countless times to consume fruits with utmost caution. Seasonal fruits like watermelon and grapes are high in glycemic index (GI), and thus with it comes the question — Can a diabetic have fruits? Is it safe?However, bursting the myth, a diabetic can enjoy fruits, but simply need to make strategic decisions based on fruit and how much to consume as per its GI as it assists the person in selecting fruit.  Fruits like watermelon have a glycemic index (GI) of 72 per 100 g serving, but one watchful serving of the fruit contains little carbs and will have minimal effect on the blood sugar level.It is safe to consume blackberries, apples, avocados, strawberries, plums, grapefruit, peaches, pears, and cherries in watchful quantity as they have 20-49 GI levels, which technically classifies them as low GI fruit. With lots of fibre and a low GI, these fruits help improve blood sugar tolerance.People who have diabetes are usually advised to keep an eye on the number of carbohydrates and portion size of their meal, even if it contains low GI, which is indeed true. While consuming fruits certain factors such as the ripeness of the fruit that influences its GI should be taken into account."

Not only as spices, but ginger has been a traditional remedy in many cultures for thousands of years. After all, it is loaded with impeccable health benefits. While we have been told time and again that ginger carries innumerable nutritious benefits, it’s rarely discussed that this magical ingredient can also cause side effects.Although the side effects usually happen after excessive intake of ginger, several cases have been witnessed where it aggravates the health issues. So let’s learn more about the side effects.As ginger carries antiplatelet properties, excessive intake of ginger may cause bleeding. Not just this, but if it is consumed with clove or garlic, it further increases the risk of excessive bleeding.The most common symptoms of basic side effects caused by excessive ginger intake are skin rashes, eye redness, dyspnea, itching, swollen lips, itchy eyes, and throat discomfort. In such circumstances, it is advised to immediately seek medical attention.Consuming ginger beyond the prescribed limit of 1500 mg per day may even lead to the risk of miscarriage. Therefore it is advised to avoid too much ginger during pregnancy and intake it only after consulting the doctor"

This shows that food is one of the most important parts of our lives. One day we skip a meal, and our body starts reacting in a different way. While what we eat matters, another thing that plays a part is when we eat our meals. The time of having breakfast, lunch and dinner are vital to determine many health benefits. There is a common saying, “Early to bed, early to rise, makes us healthy, wealthy and wise.” Let’s turn it up a little and say, early dinner and early breakfast are all you need to be healthy and smart.Breakfast: Breakfast is the first meal of the day which makes our guts wake up. Usually, breakfast is eaten after 8 to 10 hours of having our dinner. The best time to have the first meal of the day is between 7 am to 9 am.Lunch: When you eat your breakfast early, it gives your stomach enough time to rest before you go on to your lunch. This aids digestion of breakfast. The best time to have lunch is between 12 noon to 2 pm. Dinner: As you have had your lunch early, you might feel hungry soon in the evening. Many dieticians recommend having early dinner in order to satisfy our hunger as well as boost metabolism. You should have your dinner between 6.30 pm to 8 pm.  If you have all your meals on a scheduled time daily, then it can help you boost your metabolism. In the morning, your metabolic rate works best, and as the day passes, it slows down. Therefore, having an early breakfast gives it a boost and an early dinner help it sustain."

I’m talking about age old dahi or curd. In my grandmother’s home where I lived for the first 15 years of my life and even when we moved lock stock and tapeli to where my parents made their new home, dahi was always made in the kitchen. It was a daily process. Every day milk would be boiled and cooled to room temperature. A medium-heavy bottomed pot would be greased with the previous day’s dahi, which worked like a bacterial curd starter, and the boiled warm milk would be poured in. A wet cloth kept the milk covered as nature created magic, fermented the milk, added wonderfully healthy probiotic characteristics, thickened it and set it to curd. It would take four to five hours on a normal warm, hot and humid Mumbai day, eight to 12 in cold weather, that was it. Sometimes we’d make curd two times a day, just to be able to have it fresh. There was also a kind of romantic uncertainty about how well the curd would set. Sometimes it could set loosely, separating the water from the milk and sometimes it would be firm and silky. After all milk wasn’t bought homogenised, standardised and in a carton, but was bought at the doorstep from a doodhwala, whose honesty was always in question. So obviously, the better the milk the better the curd. The pot of milk with the curd starter would always be kept in a warm place and most importantly left alone. One old ladies’ tale was that you could add a green chilly with its stem intact to help the curd set faster. Ostensibly, the chilly with the stem would not impart any taste but contained certain bacteria that activated the milk to produce protein curdles that turned milk into curd faster. I’d actually never seen that happening in any of our kitchens."

            "description": "Every now and then, we stress upon the fact of eating lots of fruits and vegetables as they are packed with nutrients. They are said to be the best way to provide nutrition to the body and boost immunity. Every season comes with a variety of grains, vegetables, and fruits and we can’t agree more that they are tastier than the stored ones. However, do you know with time the nutrition value of fruits and vegetables are declining? Yes, you read that right. With time, due to various reasons that nutrition in fruits and vegetables have declined tremendously leaving us with various deficiencies. According to a National Geographic report, the experts find the root of the problem in the quality of soil. In the last few decades, the soil quality has been compromised due to various reasons including excessive chemical use, fertilisers, irrigation and so on. The harvesting methods have changed from natural ways to machineries which has also taken a dig at the health of the soil. Apart from it, due to global warming and climate change, the atmospheric temperature is rising and making the soil lose its moisture even more that do not hold the crops well putting them in risk of losing nutrition.The report also states that due to carbon dioxide increase in the air, the nutrient content of the fruits, vegetables and other crops are pulling down.David R. Montgomery, a professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington in Seattle emphasis on one of the major risks of the lower nutrient value, that is making our immunity low. According to him, “Nutrient decline is going to leave our bodies with fewer of the components they need to mount defences against chronic diseases — it’s going to undercut the value of food as preventive medicine,” state National Geographic."

            "description": "If you are a fitness enthusiast and a vegan, you might be one of the people who have tofu in their meals instead of paneer. While many people find it easily in the supermarket, others may find it difficult to spot tofu at their local stores. If you are one of those people, don’t worry as this simple method can help you make protein-rich tofu at home with just two ingredients – chickpeas and water.Once the tofu is set, you can use it as and when required. It is as tasty as the tofu bought from a store and tofu is as versatile as cottage cheese. It can be used in dry and wet recipes depending on your mood and diet requirements. Chickpea is rich in protein and hence the tofu is a great source of protein to help you complete the daily protein requirement.Soak the chickpeas overnight after thoroughly washing with the help of a strainer under running water.Drain all the water and wash the chickpeas the next day. Add chickpeas with two cups of water in a blender and blend in batches until you have a smooth mixture.Strain the blended chickpeas through a muslin cloth into a bowl. Make a squeezable bag out of the muslin cloth with the mixture in it. Squeeze the blend well to strain it nicely. As the water drains slowly from the mixture, it takes some time to strain the blend.Take the strained blend and put it in a pot. Keep the pot on full flame and let the mixture boil. Once you see bubbles, lower the flame and cook the blend for another half n hour. The mixture will thicken with time. When it is thick enough, put off the flame and let the blend cool down for a while. Leave the mixture in a container for more than 2 hours idle. This will ensure that the mixture sits and the tofu sets properly"
